illumio coding challenge

I put the rules in a csv file which exists in the repository. I used pandas to load the csv file into a dataframe and queried the input based on the dataframe. Each row in the dataframe represents a rule for accepting a packet. The sample rules are uploaded under 'sample_rules.csv'. The function 'accept_packet()' takes 4 arguments and returns a boolean variable if the packet is accepted or not.
